For example, when you are playing a game, at the end of it, a certain shape appears. When this shape appears, look into the eyes of the child and show some surprise and joy. Also, when you notice that your son is practicing a certain activity, try to draw his attention to the fact that you are following and excited about what he is doing. This shows him that you are aware of what he is doing and are waiting for it.",

Try to show your admiration for everything your child makes, as if you see it for the first time (for example, when your son makes a paper ship). 'For a baby who might be developing autism, you want to enter their world and make it fun,' says Dr. Dawson.",

'Songs turn routine moments into chances to communicate, and because words are attached to a melody, it's easier for your baby to engage with themâ€”especially when there are gestures that go along with what you're singing,' says Dr. Shulman.",

        "turns_content" => "Try to get your child to imitate you in actions, to do the thing first and then your child to do it helps your child to communicate. There are many games that help you in this, the simplest of which is the exchange of the ball (to throw the ball to him, and he throws it to you again) 'One early sign that a child has autism is that they don't initiate communication, so you want to help your baby grasp that it's something they can do,' says Dr. Shulman.",

You can do a dance or fun movements to draw your child's attention to you. 'A child who may have autism struggles to grasp that people are more important than objects,' says Dr. Korb",
